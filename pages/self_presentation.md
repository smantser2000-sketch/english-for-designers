**I describe myself as a multi-talented creative person. My main focus lies at the intersection of UI/UX design and digital art, where I love combining aesthetic appeal with user-centered functionality.**

**I am currently a student at VŠKK. My passion for creativity started very early — as you can see from these childhood photos, I’ve always been drawn to visual expression. This foundation led me to where I am today.**

**Besides design, I’ve spent significant time working as a model in cities like Bordeaux, Minsk, and Paris. This experience has been invaluable because it taught me a lot about composition, lighting, and how to build a personal brand, which you can see on my social media.**

**I worked on the interface for 'The Warhol' museum app. My goal was to create a clean, modern look. I designed everything from the entry screens to the ticket booking system, focusing on a seamless user flow for art enthusiasts.**

**Another big part of my work is poster design. Here is a collection of posters I created for various events, such as FAMUFEST and exhibitions in Prague and Warsaw. I enjoy experimenting with bold typography and different graphic styles to match the mood of each event.**

**My third project is a game called 'VE STÍNU' (In the Shadow). It’s a psychological detective game where players have to identify a spy.**

**For this project, I designed the gameplay mechanics and the UI. I focused on creating an engaging atmosphere through the interface, including features like the 'Spy’s Superpower' and the voting system. It was a great challenge to balance game logic with visual clarity.**
