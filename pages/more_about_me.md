# My Creative Journey



Hi there! I’m Maryia, and my life has always been a vibrant blend of creativity and structure. Since childhood, I was naturally drawn to the arts—drawing, singing, and dancing—but my true passion was tactile creation, like working with clay and crafts. Funnily enough, I also loved playing the teacher, setting up elaborate, game-like lessons for my family.

My journey into art started in a specialized secondary school with an artistic focus, which required me to attend a dedicated art school. It was there I discovered that I was less interested in academic drawing and far more captivated by making things with my own hands. That lifelong love for visual arts and photography kept bubbling away while I searched for my professional calling. After finishing college with a degree in Sociocultural Activities, I moved to the Czech Republic. My original plans quickly changed when my desire to merge aesthetic beauty with practical functionality ignited a bold career shift: I decided to become a designer.

I had zero experience in Adobe programs, but I set an ambitious goal. Through two months of intense, focused self-study, I managed to build a portfolio and successfully gain admission to design school. It was during my studies that I took a UI/UX Design course, and I immediately knew I had found my niche. This field is the perfect marriage of my analytical mind and my creative drive to craft convenient, seamless, and human-centered digital products.

Outside of design, I actively pursue my creative side as a model, which sharpens my eye for composition, lighting, and visual storytelling—skills that directly enhance my digital work. This, combined with developing my personal brand on social media, allows me to constantly explore diverse contexts of visual communication, connecting and inspiring others through both my presence and my projects.
